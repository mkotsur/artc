Artc (pronounced artÂ·sy) is an Active Read-Through Cache for cats-effect programs. Its primary goal is to allow developers to write as little code as possible to solve a common problem of reading data from services with high latency.

### Motivation
Sometimes you need to integrate with slow services. This is rarely a pleasant problem to solve, but it doesn't have to take weeks to solve and destroy your development experience. Artc is here to help! 

### Main features:
* Non-blocking read-through;
* Active content synchronization;
* Automatic refresh rate adjustment;
* Use it as a library or REST microservice.

## Example

```scala
import io.github.mkotsur.artc.Cache
import cats.effect.{ExitCode, IO, IOApp}

case class User(name: String)

val settings: Cache.Settings  = ???
val readSource: IO[List[User]] = ???

for {
  cache <- Cache.create(settings, readSource)
  updateSharesFiber <- cache.scheduleUpdates.start
  _ <- {
    // Your logic goes here 
     cache.latest.flatMap(v => IO(println(v)))
    }   
  _ <- updateSharesFiber.join
} yield ExitCode.Success
```
